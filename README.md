Evaluation of a vision-based human following robot under varying illuminations.
A meticulous and robust system for object detection and tracking is still a milestone in the field of computer vision. The various factors that hinder the accuracy of the model includes illumination, noise in the scene, occlusion effect and pose variations of which the source of illumination and its orientation with respect to the object plays a pivotal role. An illumination variation may result in the tracking algorithm to lose the object in the scene. This paper proposes a simulation of a robot which follows a human under varying illumination induced by varying heights and locations of the illuminating source with respect to the human. The camera on the robot is aided by a histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) approach with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for detection and tracking of the human in the scene.
